## Project Overview

Real estate is a highly dynamic and competitive market, and accurately predicting house prices is crucial for buyers, sellers, and investors. Machine learning models can assist in making more informed decisions by predicting house prices based on historical data and various property attributes. This project aims to develop a robust house price prediction model using a dataset of real estate listings.

The key objectives of this project include:
- Data collection and preprocessing: Obtaining a clean and relevant dataset with features like the number of bedrooms, square footage, neighborhood, and other relevant attributes.
- Model development: Building and training machine learning models to predict house prices accurately.
- Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
- Deployment (optional): Creating an interface or service to allow users to input house features and obtain price predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is not included in this repository due to its size. However, you can obtain it from [source link] or by contacting the project maintainers. The dataset should be placed in the `/data` directory.

## Installation

To set up the environment for this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-house-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd real-estate-house-price-prediction
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Here are the basic steps to use this project:

1. Prepare the dataset:
   - Obtain the real estate dataset and place it in the `/data` directory.
   - Preprocess the dataset by running data cleaning and feature engineering scripts as necessary.

2. Train the model:
   - Use Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to train different machine learning models on the prepared dataset.
   - Tune hyperparameters and evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

3. Evaluate the model:
   - Assess the model's performance on a test dataset.
   - Visualize results and analyze errors to gain insights into model performance.

4. Deployment (optional):
   - If desired, deploy the trained model as a web application or API for real-time house price predictions.
